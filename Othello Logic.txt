The Thought Process Behind my Code

Implemention of the Board
I decided to use a struct that contained a 2D char array to hold the information for each board space
I used the character '*' to symbolise a blank space on the board - ie one not occupied by a white/black disks
I first initialised my board struct to be be all 'blank spaces' except for the four mandatory spaces that had to be filled with two white and two black pieces.

Implementation of the Players
When asking the users to input their names I automatically assigned the first player to be black and the second player to be white.
I take the user names and store them in global char array variables so I can use their names in multiple functions.

Implementation of the discs
I implemented the discs by using the character 'B' and 'W' to represent a black disc and white disc repectively. If a move is seen as valid I would then change the '*' symbol to whatever character (either 'B' or 'W') that the move dictates.

Implementation of a move
I used another struct to store the move inputted by the player and to store the current player information. I took in the users move in the format a1 where a can be between a-h (to represent the columns) and 1 can be between 1-8 (to represent the rows) I then stored these characters in temporary variables and then translated them to their correct array index notation.

Game Logic
The game started of with player 1 (black) going first.
I took in a move as described above and checked to see if it was valid.
To check if it was valid I
